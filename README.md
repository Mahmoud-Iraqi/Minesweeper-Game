### If you think there is a mine somewhere you can right-click it and it will be marked as a mine candidate with blue, to unselect it right-click it again

### If you click on a mine a window will pop on the screen telling you that was a mine and it will be a red cell

## To win, you need to minimize the number of mines you step on. Try to survive. :)
